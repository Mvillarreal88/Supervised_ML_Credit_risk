### Analysis:


The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model to classifies the risk level of given loans. I used the 2019 dataset to predict the 2020 datasets and scored the training and testing of both. Below i give my predictions on linear regression as well as Random forest classifiers before they were ran.

### Predictions:

• Logistic regression:
- My thought is the training data should be simalarly close to the testing data. However i predict some issues with fitting as linear regression may be prone to this given the number of features in the data sets.

• Random Forest classifier.
- My thought is the Random forest classifier will be alot higher due to it working well with larger datasets. In this case we have alot of rows that the random forest will be able to score. The random forest classifier is also less sensitive to outliers.

### Final thoughts:

- So its interesting once I scaled the data and then ran the training and testing scores they actually decreased. Not only by a little bit my training went from .70 down to .50's and the training and testing dipped by half. I would go back to the data and see if there is maybe a better dataset to use.
